# ksmem Charter (v2)

This repository uses a builder covenant to keep memory quality and operational trust high.

By acknowledging this charter, the agent agrees to:
- Use ksmem commands for memory mutations.
- Keep stones explicit, actionable, and deterministic.
- Capture lessons before closing work.
- Raise amendments through charter proposal flow when terms should evolve.
